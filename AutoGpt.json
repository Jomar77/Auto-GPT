of renewable energy\nPublished: 18 August 2022\nThe share of energy supply from renewables is at a record 30-year high, an annual Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) report into the energy sector shows.\nOn this page\nReleased today, Energy in New Zealand 2022 is MBIE’s annual round-up of the energy sector, highlighting key trends in energy supply, transformation and demand for the 2021 calendar year.Energy in New Zealand 2022“The report shows the share of energy supply from renewables was 40.8%, the highest since reporting started in 1990. Twenty-eight % of energy consumption also came from renewables, the highest it has been since 2016,” says Mike Hayward, Manager Markets, Digital, Data & Insights, at MBIE.The renewable share for electricity generation increased to 82.1% for 2021, up from 81.1% in 2020. This was despite La Niña conditions causing below average hydro storage and inflows, which led to an increase in coal use for electricity generation in the first half of the year.“We’re also seeing that while energy consumption increased by 0.7% compared to 2020, it is yet to return to pre-COVID levels,” Mike Hayward said.Energy consumption by households was the only sector where consumption surpassed 2019 levels, with two factors driving this being the move to Alert level 4 in August 2021, and colder weather conditions.“Conversely, in the domestic transport sector, we saw consumption increase 5% compared to 2020, which will likely be due to COVID-19 related travel restrictions easing throughout the year allowing for people to travel around New Zealand.”For further insights, visit the New Zealand Energy Dashboard(external link).\nMBIE media contactEmail: media@mbie.govt.nz\nTags\nEnergy\nBack to News\nShare:\nhttps://www.mbie.govt.nz/about/news/energy-in-new-zealand-2022-shows-a-strong-share-of-renewable-energy/\nPlease note: This content will change over time and can go out of date.\nFeedback\nNavigation\nAbout\nBuilding and energy\nBusiness and employment\nCross-government functions\nImmigration and tourism\nScience and technology\nConnect\nContact us\nFeedback\nHave your say\nOur websites\nWork for us\nFollow\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\nYouTube\nNew Zealand Government - Te Kāwanatanga o Aotearoa\nCopyright\nDisclaimer\nPrivacy\nChild Protection\n© Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment\n© Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment\nhttps://www.mbie.govt.nz/about/news/energy-in-new-zealand-2022-shows-a-strong-share-of-renewable-energy/","Source: https://www.mbie.govt.nz/about/news/energy-in-new-zealand-2022-shows-a-strong-share-of-renewable-energy/\nContent summary part#2: According to the annual report \"Energy in New Zealand 2022\" by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, the share of energy supply from renewables in New Zealand is at a record 30-year high, with 40.8% of energy supply coming from renewables, the highest since reporting started in 1990.

of renewable energy\nPublished: 18 August 2022\nThe share of energy supply from renewables is at a record 30-year high, an annual Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) report into the energy sector shows.\nOn this page\nReleased today, Energy in New Zealand 2022 is MBIE’s annual round-up of the energy sector, highlighting key trends in energy supply, transformation and demand for the 2021 calendar year.Energy in New Zealand 2022“The report shows the share of energy supply from renewables was 40.8%, the highest since reporting started in 1990. Twenty-eight % of energy consumption also came from renewables, the highest it has been since 2016,” says Mike Hayward, Manager Markets, Digital, Data & Insights, at MBIE.The renewable share for electricity generation increased to 82.1% for 2021, up from 81.1% in 2020. This was despite La Niña conditions causing below average hydro storage and inflows, which led to an increase in coal use for electricity generation in the first half of the year.“We’re also seeing that while energy consumption increased by 0.7% compared to 2020, it is yet to return to pre-COVID levels,” Mike Hayward said.Energy consumption by households was the only sector where consumption surpassed 2019 levels, with two factors driving this being the move to Alert level 4 in August 2021, and colder weather conditions.“Conversely, in the domestic transport sector, we saw consumption increase 5% compared to 2020, which will likely be due to COVID-19 related travel restrictions easing throughout the year allowing for people to travel around New Zealand.”For further insights, visit the New Zealand Energy Dashboard(external link).\nMBIE media contactEmail: media@mbie.govt.nz\nTags\nEnergy\nBack to News\nShare:\nhttps://www.mbie.govt.nz/about/news/energy-in-new-zealand-2022-shows-a-strong-share-of-renewable-energy/\nPlease note: This content will change over time and can go out of date.\nFeedback\nNavigation\nAbout\nBuilding and energy\nBusiness and employment\nCross-government functions\nImmigration and tourism\nScience and technology\nConnect\nContact us\nFeedback\nHave your say\nOur websites\nWork for us\nFollow\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\nYouTube\nNew Zealand Government - Te Kāwanatanga o Aotearoa\nCopyright\nDisclaimer\nPrivacy\nChild Protection\n© Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment\n© Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment\nhttps://www.mbie.govt.nz/about/news/energy-in-new-zealand-2022-shows-a-strong-share-of-renewable-energy/","Source: https://www.mbie.govt.nz/about/news/energy-in-new-zealand-2022-shows-a-strong-share-of-renewable-energy/\nContent summary part#2: According to the annual report \"Energy in New Zealand 2022\" by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, the share of energy supply from renewables in New Zealand is at a record 30-year high, with 40.8% of energy supply coming from renewables, the highest since reporting started in 1990.

The report also shows that 28% of energy consumption came from renewables, the highest it has been since 2016. The renewable share for electricity generation increased to 82.1% for 2021, despite La Niña conditions causing below average hydro storage and inflows, which led to an increase in coal use for electricity generation in the first half of the year. \\n \\n Links: ['Skip to main content (https://www.mbie.govt.nz/about/news/energy-in-new-zealand-2022-shows-a-strong-share-of-renewable-energy/#main)', 'Skip to main navigation (https://www.mbie.govt.nz/about/news/energy-in-new-zealand-2022-shows-a-strong-share-of-renewable-energy/#mainNav)', 'Skip to site search (https://www.mbie.govt.nz/about/news/energy-in-new-zealand-2022-shows-a-strong-share-of-renewable-energy/#siteSearch)', 'Skip to navigation within this section (https://www.mbie.govt.nz/about/news/energy-in-new-zealand-2022-shows-a-strong-share-of-renewable-energy/#pageNav)', '\\\\n\\\\n (https://www.mbie.govt.nz/)']\", <selenium.webdriver.chrome.webdriver.WebDriver (session=\"678d267de569fcc1b9dbfa15821b3450\")>) \nHuman Feedback: GENERATE NEXT COMMAND JSON ","Assistant Reply: {\n    \"thoughts\": {\n        \"text\": \"I should use the \\'google\\' command to relate geographic and climate patterns in relation to the feasibility of green energy infrastructures in New Zealand.\",\n        \"reasoning\": \"By relating geographic and climate patterns in relation to the feasibility of green energy infrastructures in New Zealand, I can identify areas where green energy projects are most likely to be successful.
